## Overview 

Since Fedora switched their default filesystem to btrfs I decided to give it a go as I am exclusively using btrfs on all my systems, see: [Why I (still) like btrfs](../../btrfs/). Fedora's automatic installation routine with encryption is actually almost perfect for me except some changes regarding the btrfs mount options.

So, in this guide I will show how to install Fedora 35 with automatic system snapshots and backups using [BTRBK](https://github.com/digint/btrbk) which will regularly take (almost instant) btrfs snapshots of the system and send/receive these to a backup disk given a chosen retention policy.[^1]
  
[^1]: Note that in a previous guide for [Fedora 33](../fedora-btrfs-33) I showed how to rename the default subvolumes in Fedora from `root` and `home` to `@` and `@home` in order to make [Timeshift](https://github.com/teejee2008/timeshift) work properly. However, in this guide, I will focus on BTRBK instead of Timeshift as it provides an automatic way to not only make snapshots (like Timeshift) but also to make backups to another disk via btrfs send/receive. Moreover, in the previous guide I also showed how to optionally encrypt the boot partition; however, I typically use a Yubikey to unlock my luks partition(s) and that only works with a non-encrypted boot partition. Moreover, my personal thread level is that it is more likely that I'll loose my Laptop and I don't want people to access my files. The scenario where a person injects malicious code into my boot partition and the kernel files to then take over my computer is not relevant for me.

**If you ever need to rollback your system, checkout [Restoring backups with BTRBK](https://github.com/digint/btrbk#restoring-backups).**


## Step 0: General remarks
**I strongly advise to try the following installation steps in a virtual machine first before doing anything like that on real hardware!**

So, let's spin up a virtual machine with 4 cores, 8 GB RAM, and a 64GB disk using e.g. the awesome [quickemu](https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu) project. I can confirm that the installation works equally well on my Dell XPS 13 9360 and my Dell Precision 7520. In the following, however, I outline the steps for my Dell Precision 7520 with a NVME drive which I use for the system files and another SSD which is used for btrfs backups.

This tutorial is made with Fedora 35 Workstation from https://getfedora.org/de/workstation/download/ copied to an installation media (usually a USB Flash device but may be a DVD or the ISO file attached to a virtual machine hypervisor).


## Step 1: Graphical installer with automatic configuration and encryption
Boot the installation medium in UEFI mode and choose `Install to Hard Drive`. Choose your language, Keyboard, Time & Date setting. Note that the `Done` button is in the top left corner. Then hit `Installation Destination`. Choose your harddisk and

- select `Automatic` under `Storage Configuration`
- `Encrypt my data` under `Encryption`

Click `Done` and enter your disk encryption passphrase, choose a good one. If there is still data on your disk, you need to choose `Reclaim space` and remove existing file systems that you don't need anymore. I usually hit `Delete all`. After you've finished select `Reclaim space`. You will return to the Installation Summary screen. Click `Begin Installation` (in the lower right corner). When the installation process is finished, select `Finish Installation`. Reboot your system and go through the welcome screen. I also enable `Third-party repositories` already.

Let's update the system (either via software center or the terminal):

```sh
sudo dnf update
flatpak update
```

Reboot one more time:
```sh
sudo reboot now
```

## Step 2 (optional): Understand the partition layout and installation structure
This is just for your nerdy side if you want to familiarize yourself with some commands that are useful when working with btrfs, partition layouts, and mount points.

So, let's open a terminal and have a look on the default partition layout:
```sh
sudo lsblk
# NAME                                          MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE  MOUNTPOINTS

#                                                                          /
sudo parted /dev/nvme0n1 unit MiB print

# /dev/zram0: LABEL="zram0" UUID="62d6119a-a230-4561-8b97-665a19d13267" TYPE="swap"
```
In my case `sda` is an internal SSD that I use for [my backup strategy](../../backup/#5-dell-precision-7520-linux), whereas `zram0` is the swap partition. The system is installed to `nvme0n1` and it has 3 partitions:

1. a 600 MiB FAT32 EFI partition
1. a 1024 MiB EXT4 partition for /boot
1. a 486761MiB partition that contains the luks2 encrypted system files

Let's have a closer look at the luks2-encrypted partition:

```sh
sudo cryptsetup luksDump /dev/nvme0n1p3

```
So this basically uses the default options to encrypt a partition with luks v2 (e.g. `cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/nvme0n1p3`). Let's have a look what is inside the encrypted partition:

```sh
sudo cat /etc/crypttab
# luks-8bf48ffa-78e1-4a16-ad9e-301b7199d8ac UUID=8bf48ffa-78e1-4a16-ad9e-301b7199d8ac none discard

ls /dev/mapper
# control  luks-8bf48ffa-78e1-4a16-ad9e-301b7199d8ac

sudo lsblk /dev/mapper/luks-8bf48ffa-78e1-4a16-ad9e-301b7199d8ac -f

# ID 256 gen 51 top level 5 path home
# ID 257 gen 52 top level 5 path root
# ID 262 gen 26 top level 257 path var/lib/machines
``` 

From the `crypttab` we see that the mapped luks device is named `luks-8bf48ffa-78e1-4a16-ad9e-301b7199d8ac` where the number is the UUID of `/dev/nvme0n1p3`. The crypt is formatted with btrfs and contains three subvolumes

1. `home`: this is where `/home` is mounted to
1. `root`: this is where `/` is mounted to
1. `var/lib/machines` this is a nested subvolume to exclude virtual machine files (which tend to change all the times) from snapshots of `home` and `root`

This is also evident from the fstab:

```sh 
sudo cat /etc/fstab
# UUID=df2d4761-d84b-4fea-af88-2dd5d7eeca4c /                       btrfs   subvol=root,compress=zstd:1,x-systemd.device-timeout=0 0 0
# UUID=c791c518-83e5-4dd5-8cdf-a47621f9019b /boot                   ext4    defaults        1 2
# UUID=4882-915D          /boot/efi               vfat    umask=0077,shortname=winnt 0 2
# UUID=df2d4761-d84b-4fea-af88-2dd5d7eeca4c /home                   btrfs   subvol=home,compress=zstd:1,x-systemd.device-timeout=0 0 0
```
where `UUID=df2d4761-d84b-4fea-af88-2dd5d7eeca4c` is the UUID of the mapped device `/dev/mapper/luks-8bf48ffa-78e1-4a16-ad9e-301b7199d8ac`. Note that by default the only optimized mount option is `zstd:1` which turns on compression.

Lastly, swap is using 8GB of ZRAM:

```sh
sudo swapon
# NAME       TYPE      SIZE USED PRIO
# /dev/zram0 partition   8G   0B  100
```


## Step 3: Post-Installation steps

**All the steps below should be run from an interactive root shell:**
```sh
sudo -i
```
Otherwise some commands might not work properly.

### Step 3a: Mount the btrfs top-level filesystem to /btrfs_pool

Let's mount our the top-level btrfs volume (which has always id 5) to a mount point `/btrfs_pool` using the fstab:

```sh
mkdir /btrfs_pool
echo "UUID=$(blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/mapper/luks-$(blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/nvme0n1p3))  /btrfs_pool  btrfs  subvolid=5,compress=zstd:1,x-systemd.device-timeout=0 0 0" >> /etc/fstab

cat /etc/fstab
# UUID=df2d4761-d84b-4fea-af88-2dd5d7eeca4c /                       btrfs   subvol=root,compress=zstd:1,x-systemd.device-timeout=0 0 0
# UUID=c791c518-83e5-4dd5-8cdf-a47621f9019b /boot                   ext4    defaults        1 2
# UUID=4882-915D                            /boot/efi               vfat    umask=0077,shortname=winnt 0 2
# UUID=df2d4761-d84b-4fea-af88-2dd5d7eeca4c /home                   btrfs   subvol=home,compress=zstd:1,x-systemd.device-timeout=0 0 0
# UUID=df2d4761-d84b-4fea-af88-2dd5d7eeca4c /btrfs_pool             btrfs   subvolid=5,compress=zstd:1,x-systemd.device-timeout=0 0 0

mount -av
# /                        : ignored
# /boot                    : already mounted
# /boot/efi                : already mounted
# /home                    : already mounted
# mount: /btrfs_pool does not contain SELinux labels.
#        You just mounted a file system that supports labels which does not
#        contain labels, onto an SELinux box. It is likely that confined
#        applications will generate AVC messages and not be allowed access to
#        this file system.  For more details see restorecon(8) and mount(8).
# /btrfs_pool              : successfully mounted

ls /btrfs_pool
# home root
```
I am not sure what the `SELinux labels` warning means or how to avoid that, so if do you, let me know. I guess after the reboot this should not be a problem as you cannot have different mount options on the same partition (see below the `seclabel` mount option is set). Anyways, we can access our subvolumes from `/btrfs_pool`.


### Step 3b (optionally): use optimized mount options
As the development of BTRFS continues and Fedora keeps pushing improvements upstream, I only change three mount options to optimize performance and durability on SSD or NVME drives:

- `ssd`: use SSD specific options for optimal use on SSD and NVME (this is probably redundant as BTRFS detects SSDs and NVMes automatically)
- `compress=zstd`: allows to specify the compression algorithm which we want to use. btrfs provides lzo, zstd and zlib compression algorithms. Based on some Phoronix test cases, zstd seems to be the better performing candidate. Fedora has started to use v1, I will use v3.
- `discard=async`: [Btrfs Async Discard Support Looks To Be Ready For Linux 5.6](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Btrfs-Async-Discard)

Let's make these changes with a text editor, e.g. `nano /etc/fstab` or use these `sed` commands which replace the mount options
```sh
sed -i 's/compress=zstd:1/ssd,compress=zstd,discard=async/' /etc/fstab
```

Either way your `fstab` should look like this:
```sh
cat /etc/fstab
# UUID=df2d4761-d84b-4fea-af88-2dd5d7eeca4c /            btrfs   subvol=root,ssd,compress=zstd,discard=async,x-systemd.device-timeout=0  0 0
# UUID=c791c518-83e5-4dd5-8cdf-a47621f9019b /boot        ext4    defaults                                                                1 2
# UUID=4882-915D                            /boot/efi    vfat    umask=0077,shortname=winnt                                              0 2
# UUID=df2d4761-d84b-4fea-af88-2dd5d7eeca4c /home        btrfs   subvol=home,ssd,compress=zstd,discard=async,x-systemd.device-timeout=0  0 0
# UUID=df2d4761-d84b-4fea-af88-2dd5d7eeca4c /btrfs_pool  btrfs   subvolid=5,ssd,compress=zstd,discard=async,x-systemd.device-timeout=0   0 0
```

Let's reboot to see whether this worked:
```sh
reboot now
```

So after the restart, check the following:
```sh
mount -v | grep /dev/mapper
# /dev/mapper/luks-8bf48ffa-78e1-4a16-ad9e-301b7199d8ac on / type btrfs (rw,relatime,seclabel,compress=zstd:3,ssd,discard=async,space_cache,subvolid=257,subvol=/root)
# /dev/mapper/luks-8bf48ffa-78e1-4a16-ad9e-301b7199d8ac on /btrfs_pool type btrfs (rw,relatime,seclabel,compress=zstd:3,ssd,discard=async,space_cache,subvolid=5,subvol=/)
# /dev/mapper/luks-8bf48ffa-78e1-4a16-ad9e-301b7199d8ac on /home type btrfs (rw,relatime,seclabel,compress=zstd:3,ssd,discard=async,space_cache,subvolid=256,subvol=/home)
```
This should reflect the changes you just made in the fstab. Note that you cannot have different mount options for your subvolumes on the same partition.

## Step 4: automatic snapshots and backups with btrfs using BTRBK
**All the steps below should be run from an interactive root shell:**
```sh
sudo -i
```
Otherwise some commands might not work properly.

### Step 4a: preparations
If you haven't done already, create a mount point `/btrfs_pool` for the top-level root of my btrfs partition (see above) as BTRBK needs a folder or subvolume to store the snapshots under the top-level. Let's call this folder `_btrbk_snap`:
```sh
mkdir /btrfs_pool/_btrbk_snap
ls /btrfs_pool
# _btrbk_snap home root
```
Note that `_btrbk_snap` is a folder, whereas `home` and `root` are subvolumes.

### Step 4b: install and configure BTRBK for snapshots
Install BTRBK from the repos:
```sh
dnf install -y btrbk
```
Next let's create the following configuration file at the default location `/etc/btrbk/` (there is also a `btrbk.conf.example` file with more explanations):
```sh
nano /etc/btrbk/btrbk.conf
```
My configuration file (just for snapshots, I'll cover the configuration file with a target for send/receive backups below) looks like this:
```sh
transaction_log         /var/log/btrbk.log
lockfile                /var/lock/btrbk.lock
timestamp_format        long

snapshot_dir            _btrbk_snap
snapshot_preserve_min   3h
snapshot_preserve       6h 5d 3w 1m

volume /btrfs_pool
  snapshot_create  always
  subvolume root
  subvolume home
```
This looks into `/btrfs_pool` and creates snapshots for the subvolumes `root` and `home` into the directory `/btrfs_pool/_btrbk_snap`. All snapshots are preserved for at least 3 hours, while the usual retention policy is to keep 6 hourly, 5 daily, 3 weekly and 1 monthly snapshot. Let's test this:

```sh
btrbk dryrun
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Backup Summary (btrbk command line client, version 0.28.3)
# 
#     Date:   Tue Dec 14 10:34:23 2021
#     Config: /etc/btrbk.conf
#     Dryrun: YES
# 
# Legend:
#     ===  up-to-date subvolume (source snapshot)
#     +++  created subvolume (source snapshot)
#     ---  deleted subvolume
#     ***  received subvolume (non-incremental)
#     >>>  received subvolume (incremental)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# /btrfs_pool/root
# +++ /btrfs_pool/_btrbk_snap/root.20211214T1034
# 
# /btrfs_pool/home
# +++ /btrfs_pool/_btrbk_snap/home.20211214T1034
# 
# NOTE: Dryrun was active, none of the operations above were actually executed!
```
If there was no error, let's actually run this to create our first snapshots (this should take a fraction of a second, that's the beauty of copy-on-write snapshots) and see whether they are stored correctly:
```sh
btrbk run

ls /btrfs_pool/_btrbk_snap
# home.20211214T1035  root.20211214T1035

btrfs subvolume list /
# ID 256 gen 118 top level 5 path home
# ID 257 gen 119 top level 5 path root
# ID 262 gen 101 top level 257 path var/lib/machines
# ID 266 gen 117 top level 5 path _btrbk_snap/root.20211214T1035
# ID 267 gen 118 top level 5 path _btrbk_snap/home.20211214T1035
```
Now you can always revert your system to `root.20211214T1035` or restore your home files from `home.20211214T1035`. Note that BTRBK by default creates read-only snapshots, so if you want to restore your whole system to a certain snapshot you need to follow the [restore backups with BTRBK guide](https://github.com/digint/btrbk#restoring-backups).

### Step 4c: create systemd timer for BTRBK to run every hour
On servers that run constantly I usually use the `crontab` for automatic snapshots with BTRBK; however, on my laptop I use a systemd timer instead. First let's check the timer and service that is shipped with BTRBK:
```sh
systemctl status btrbk.service
# ○ btrbk.service - btrbk backup
#      Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/btrbk.service; static)
#      Active: inactive (dead)
#        Docs: man:btrbk(1)

systemctl status btrbk.timer
# ○ btrbk.timer - btrbk daily backup
#      Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/btrbk.timer; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
#      Active: inactive (dead)
#     Trigger: n/a
#    Triggers: ● btrbk.service
```

Test if the service works (tip: you can exit the log outputs by writing `:q` or hitting `CTRL+C`):
```sh
systemctl start btrbk.service
systemctl status btrbk.service
# ○ btrbk.service - btrbk snapshots and backup
#      Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/btrbk.service; static)
#      Active: inactive (dead)
#        Docs: man:btrbk(1)
# 
# Dec 14 10:44:17 fedora.fritz.box btrbk[26497]:     ---  deleted subvolume
# Dec 14 10:44:17 fedora.fritz.box btrbk[26497]:     ***  received subvolume (non-incremental)
# Dec 14 10:44:17 fedora.fritz.box btrbk[26497]:     >>>  received subvolume (incremental)
# Dec 14 10:44:17 fedora.fritz.box btrbk[26497]: # ---------------------------------------------------------------------->

# Dec 14 10:44:17 fedora.fritz.box btrbk[26497]: +++ /btrfs_pool/_btrbk_snap/home.20211214T1044
# Dec 14 10:44:17 fedora.fritz.box systemd[1]: btrbk.service: Deactivated successfully.
# Dec 14 10:44:17 fedora.fritz.box systemd[1]: Finished btrbk snapshots and backup.

cat /var/log/btrbk.log
# 2021-12-14T10:44:17+0100 startup v0.28.3 - - - # btrbk command line client, version 0.28.3

```
Check if snapshots are created or if any errors occurred. If not, then let's make a small change to the timer
```sh
nano /lib/systemd/system/btrbk.timer
``` 
and make it run `hourly`:
```sh
[Unit]
Description=btrbk hourly snapshots and backup

[Timer]
OnCalendar=hourly
AccuracySec=10min
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start the timer:
```sh
systemctl enable btrbk.timer
# Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/btrbk.timer → /usr/lib/systemd/system/btrbk.timer.
systemctl start btrbk.timer
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl list-timers --all
```
You should see the following line (tip: you can exit by inserting `:q` or clicking `CTRL+C`):
```sh
NEXT                        LEFT          LAST                        PASSED       UNIT                         ACTIVATES                     
Tue 2021-12-14 11:00:00 CET 13min left    n/a                         n/a          btrbk.timer                  btrbk.service
```
Recheck the hourly timer after an hour (or 13min in my case) to make sure everything is working:
```sh
systemctl list-timers --all
cat /var/log/btrbk.log
ls /btrfs_pool/_btrbk_snap
```
Make sure the snapshots are created without errors.

## Step 5 (optional): Mount an encrypted backup disk as btrfs send/receive target
I use my internal SSD as a backup disk to receive the incremental btrfs snapshots. The steps, however, also work with an external USB disk.
**All the steps below should be run from an interactive root shell:**
```sh
sudo -i
```
Otherwise some commands might not work properly.

### Step 5a: Preparations
So let's create a GPT table on it, create an encrypted partition and format it with the btrfs filesystem. I usually use GParted (`dnf install gparted`); however, you can also use command-line tools like `parted`, e.g.:
```sh
parted /dev/sda mklabel gpt
# Warning: The existing disk label on /dev/sda will be destroyed and all data on this disk will
# be lost. Do you want to continue?
# Yes/No? Yes                                                               
# Information: You may need to update /etc/fstab.
parted /dev/sda mkpart primary 1MiB 100%
# Information: You may need to update /etc/fstab.
parted /dev/sda name 1 BACKUP
parted /dev/sda unit MiB print
# Model: ATA Samsung SSD 840 (scsi)
# Disk /dev/sda: 476940MiB
# Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
# Partition Table: gpt
# Disk Flags: 
# Number  Start    End        Size       File system  Name    Flags
#  1      1.00MiB  476940MiB  476939MiB               BACKUP

cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sda1
# WARNING: Device /dev/sda1 already contains a 'crypto_LUKS' superblock signature.
# WARNING!
# ========
# This will overwrite data on /dev/sda1 irrevocably.
# Are you sure? (Type 'yes' in capital letters): YES
# Enter passphrase for /dev/sda1: 
# Verify passphrase: 
```
**If you set the same passphrase as for your system disk, then you won't have to enter the passphrase twice at boot. This is what I usually do; otherwise you would need to create keyfiles which I won't cover in this guide.** 

Lets continue:
```sh
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda1 cryptbackup
# Enter passphrase for /dev/sda1: 

mkfs.btrfs /dev/mapper/cryptbackup

#     1   465.75GiB  /dev/mapper/cryptbackup
```

Let's create a mount point `/btrfs_backup` for this disk and update the fstab to mount this at boot:
```sh
mkdir /btrfs_backup
```
Of course if you are using an external USB drive then skip this and the below changes to the fstab and to the crypttab. The mount point of your external disk will be in `/media/run/$USER/` and you can simply save the passphrase to your keyring to automatically unlock it when connecting it to your system. If you work with an internal backup disk, then continue.

So, next I add an entry to the fstab to mount this at boot time:
```sh
echo "UUID=$(blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/mapper/cryptbackup)  /btrfs_backup  btrfs  subvolid=5,ssd,compress=zstd,discard=async,x-systemd.device-timeout=0,x-systemd.after=/   0 0" >> /etc/fstab

cat /etc/fstab
# UUID=df2d4761-d84b-4fea-af88-2dd5d7eeca4c  /              btrfs   subvol=root,ssd,compress=zstd,discard=async,x-systemd.device-timeout=0                    0 0
# UUID=c791c518-83e5-4dd5-8cdf-a47621f9019b  /boot          ext4    defaults                                                                                  1 2
# UUID=4882-915D                             /boot/efi      vfat    umask=0077,shortname=winnt                                                                0 2
# UUID=df2d4761-d84b-4fea-af88-2dd5d7eeca4c  /home          btrfs   subvol=home,ssd,compress=zstd,discard=async,x-systemd.device-timeout=0                    0 0
# UUID=df2d4761-d84b-4fea-af88-2dd5d7eeca4c  /btrfs_pool    btrfs   subvolid=5,ssd,compress=zstd,discard=async,x-systemd.device-timeout=0                     0 0
# UUID=94b22aac-7697-4b2b-af88-c32870807984  /btrfs_backup  btrfs   subvolid=5,ssd,compress=zstd,discard=async,x-systemd.device-timeout=0,x-systemd.after=/   0 0

mount -av
# /btrfs_backup            : successfully mounted
```

Next, we need to make the crypttab aware of the encrypted backup disk:
```sh
echo "cryptbackup UUID=$(blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/sda1) none discard" >> /etc/crypttab

cat /etc/crypttab
# luks-8bf48ffa-78e1-4a16-ad9e-301b7199d8ac UUID=8bf48ffa-78e1-4a16-ad9e-301b7199d8ac none discard
# cryptbackup                               UUID=47b0e8eb-51c8-40ad-8006-186f965236a2 none discard
```
Update the initramfs:
```sh
dracut --force --regenerate-all
```
Before we continue, let's test this by restarting the system. 
```sh
reboot now
```
If you chose the same passphrase as for your system disk, you should be only asked once for a luks passphrase. Note that you can always change the passphrase in Gnome Disks by selecting the luks partition and the symbol for options will give you an option to change the passphrase. If you want to use different passphrases then you would need to create keyfiles which is a bit messy in Fedora, so I usually simply stick to the same passphrase for convenience. If you are using an external USB drive then these steps can be skipped and you can simply add the luks passphrase to your keyring to automatically unlock it when it is connected; the mount point will be in `/media/run/$USER/`.

### Step 5b: Add target for btrfs send/receive in BTRBK configuration file
We need to add `/btrfs_backup` as a target with a retention policy in our BTRBK configuration file:
```sh
nano /etc/btrbk/btrbk.conf
```
My file with the target looks like this:
```sh
transaction_log         /var/log/btrbk.log
lockfile                /var/lock/btrbk.lock
timestamp_format        long

snapshot_dir            _btrbk_snap
snapshot_preserve_min   3h
snapshot_preserve       6h 5d 3w 1m
target_preserve_min     3h
target_preserve         24h 31d 52w

volume /btrfs_pool
  snapshot_create  always
  target send-receive /btrfs_backup
  subvolume root
  subvolume home
```
For external disks, there is an `on-demand` flag you can set, see the [example configuration for backups to a usb disk](https://github.com/digint/btrbk#example-backups-to-usb-disk).

Either way, let's run BTRBK in dry mode first:

```sh
btrbk dryrun
# WARNING: Failed to parse subvolume detail "Send transid: 0" for: /btrfs_pool

# >>> /btrfs_backup/home.20211214T1123
# 
# NOTE: Dryrun was active, none of the operations above were actually executed!
```
You can see that the first snapshots are sent in full, whereas the remaining ones are sent incrementally and therefore will be very fast. If there was no error (you can ignore the Warnings), run it:
```sh
btrbk run --progress
```
This might take a minute, because the initial backup is transferred to your backup disk. All other snapshots will be sent and received incrementally.

Check if all snapshots are both in `/btrfs_pool/_btrbk_snap` and `/btrfs_backup`:
```sh
btrfs subvolume list /btrfs_pool/_btrbk_snap
# ID 256 gen 168 top level 5 path home
# ID 257 gen 169 top level 5 path root
# ID 262 gen 159 top level 257 path root/var/lib/machines
# ID 266 gen 117 top level 5 path _btrbk_snap/root.20211214T1035
# ID 267 gen 118 top level 5 path _btrbk_snap/home.20211214T1035
# ID 270 gen 128 top level 5 path _btrbk_snap/root.20211214T1044
# ID 271 gen 129 top level 5 path _btrbk_snap/home.20211214T1044
# ID 272 gen 140 top level 5 path _btrbk_snap/root.20211214T1100
# ID 273 gen 141 top level 5 path _btrbk_snap/home.20211214T1100
# ID 274 gen 167 top level 5 path _btrbk_snap/root.20211214T1126
# ID 275 gen 169 top level 5 path _btrbk_snap/home.20211214T1126

btrfs subvolume list /btrfs_backup
# ID 256 gen 20 top level 5 path root.20211214T1035
# ID 257 gen 23 top level 5 path root.20211214T1044
# ID 258 gen 26 top level 5 path root.20211214T1100
# ID 259 gen 41 top level 5 path root.20211214T1126
# ID 260 gen 32 top level 5 path home.20211214T1035
# ID 261 gen 35 top level 5 path home.20211214T1044
# ID 262 gen 38 top level 5 path home.20211214T1100
# ID 263 gen 41 top level 5 path home.20211214T1126
```
Re-run btrbk to see that (as no files have been changed on the disk) the next snapshots and send/receive backups are instant:
```sh
btrbk run --progress
```

## Final remarks
That's it. Remember to check in the next couple of hours or days whether the systemd timer works and both snapshots as well as backups are created according to your retention policy.
